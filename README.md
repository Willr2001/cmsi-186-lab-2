# CMSI 186 Lab 2 Virtual Darts Starter Code

This repository contains some unfinished Java programs that you are complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/2/). Use the provided test scripts.

In your new repository, donâ€™t forget to edit this README file, as _your_ repository will certainly not contain any unfinished Java programs.
When running all the tests I can't see which tests I passed and failed which makes it pretty difficult to work on it.
